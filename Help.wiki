==Section headings==

''Headings'' organize your writing
into sections. The wiki software
can automatically generate a
[[Help:Section|table of contents]]
from them. Start with 2 'equals'
("==") characters.

===Subsection===

Using more 'equals' characters
creates a subsection.

====A smaller subsection====

Don't skip levels, like from two
("==") to four ("====") 'equals'
characters.

;A defined term: A semicolon at the
start of a line is a way of making
a definition where the word being
defined appears in bold.
The definition itself follows the
colon and is not rendered bold by
default. It is not a heading and 
does not appear in the table of
contents.''
